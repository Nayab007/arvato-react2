Live webpage for this project

https://arvatoproject2.netlify.app/


For this project, I wanted to show  that user can drag the location marker and get the address of any location that needs to get. You can also search by entering city name in the field blow the map. Once you refresh the page it take back to default location, which is stockholm. It works with the google API key that I got from Arvato. I Have done the testing for App.js and Home.js file and it got passed.To work on this project I did my research on google, stack overflow, medium, and some other websites. I got inspired by ideas that I saw there and decided to make this project this way.

 I wanted to keep everything simple and easy for a user to drag the marker and find the address they are looking for and it gets added automatically to the input fields.

I also set up the .env file where I stored the API key so it won't get up-loaded to GitHub or published on the website.


I would also suggest that if we are making this website for accessibility we should be careful with colors and typography. I would suggest using the library that fits the need for this. I would like to work more on this project and come up with more ideas to make this feature better for users.
