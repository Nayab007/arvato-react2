For this project, I wanted to show  I can drag the location marker and get the address of any location that needs to get. It works with the google API key that I got from Arvato. I Have done the testing for App.js and Home.js file and it got passed.

 I wanted to keep everything simple and easy for a user to drag the marker and find the address they are looking for and it gets added automatically to the input fields.

I also set up the .env file where I stored the API key so it won't get up-loaded to GitHub or published on the website.

I would also suggest that if we are making this website for accessibility we should be careful with colors and typography. I would suggest using the library that fits the need for this. I would like to work more on this project and come up with more ideas to make this feature better for users.
